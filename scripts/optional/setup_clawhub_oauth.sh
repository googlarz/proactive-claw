#!/bin/bash
# ============================================================
# NOT USED BY DEFAULT SETUP — THIS IS AN OPTIONAL HELPER ONLY
# setup.sh does NOT call this script. Most users don't need it.
# Use this ONLY if you want clawhub.ai to provide your Google
# OAuth credentials.json instead of downloading it yourself from
# Google Cloud Console.
# ============================================================
#
# Proactive Claw — OPT-IN clawhub.ai OAuth credential provisioning
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
#   Downloads your Google OAuth credentials.json from clawhub.ai using a
#   clawhub_token you have set in config.json.
#
# WHAT IS FETCHED:
#   Only the Google OAuth client definition (credentials.json) — the same file
#   you would download from Google Cloud Console. This is NOT your token.json,
#   NOT your calendar data, and NOT any personal information.
#
# WHAT IS NOT FETCHED:
#   - token.json (your Google access token — generated locally, never leaves your machine)
#   - Any calendar events or personal data
#
# HOW TO VERIFY:
#   After running this script, inspect the downloaded file:
#     cat ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/proactive-claw/credentials.json
#   It should contain only: {"installed": {"client_id": "...", "client_secret": "...", ...}}
#   No personal data. You can revoke the OAuth client at any time in Google Cloud Console.
#
# HOW TO OPT IN:
#   1. Set clawhub_token in your config.json (from clawhub.ai/settings/integrations)
#   2. Run: bash scripts/setup_clawhub_oauth.sh
#   3. Then run: bash scripts/setup.sh (for the rest of setup)
#
# This script is NOT called by setup.sh. It is a separate, explicit opt-in.
